## Cant Keep Up
This tool is made to make programmers more productive through issuing commands
via the address bar of their favorite browser.

## How to enable it in chrome
goto `settings` then under the `search` section press `Manage search engines`
now we will cantkeepup here, scroll down until you find 3 empty boxes. In the
first box `Add a new search engine` type `cantkeepup`. In the second box
`Keyword` type `cantkeepup`. In the last box `URL with %s in place of query` 
type `http://cantkeepup.herokuapp.com/?q=%s`. Then press enter, and make it the
default one by pressing the `Make default` button that appears when you hover 
of it.

ENJOY~~!
